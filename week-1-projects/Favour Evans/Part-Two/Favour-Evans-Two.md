# The Merkle Patricia Tries

## Brief Description of Merkle Patricia Tries and Their Components


A Merkle Patricia Trie (or MPT) is a type of data structure that combines two concepts:

**Merkle Trees**: A tree where every leaf node contains a hash of data, and every non-leaf node is the hash of its children. It ensures data integrity by allowing you to verify that data has not been tampered with.

**Patricia Tries**: A trie (prefix tree) that efficiently stores a set of keys with shared prefixes. It reduces storage space by merging common prefixes of keys into a single node.


### Components of a Merkle Patricia Trie:

1. Root Node: The top node in the trie. It's the point of reference for the entire data structure.

2. Branches: These represent the paths of the trie. Each branch connects nodes in the trie.

3. Leaves: The final nodes of the trie, which contain the actual data or values.

4. Hashes: Both the internal nodes and leaf nodes are hashed. This ensures that any change to the data is easily detectable because changing the data would result in a different hash.

5. Nibble: In MPT, keys are split into "nibbles" (4-bit chunks), and each nibble leads to a different node. This helps to efficiently organize and search the data.


The structure allows fast and secure searching, insertion, and verification, which is essential for blockchain systems like Ethereum.


## How Merkle Patricia Trees are Used in the EVM:

In the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), Merkle Patricia Tries are used to organize and manage different types of data such as:

+ Accounts (user balances, nonce values, etc.)
+ Storage (contract state)
+ Transactions
+ Receipts

Each piece of data in Ethereum is associated with a state (the current state of the blockchain), and this state is organized using Merkle Patricia Tries. Here's how MPTs are used:

1. Account State: Each Ethereum account is represented by a node in the trie. This node contains the account’s balance, nonce (number of transactions sent), and other data. MPT enables efficient and secure lookup, insertion, and updates of these account details.

2. Storage State: Ethereum smart contracts can store data, and this data is also organized in a Merkle Patricia Trie. Every key-value pair for contract storage is hashed, making it verifiable.

3. Block Headers: The block header contains the root hash of the Merkle Patricia Trie that holds the state of the Ethereum network at the time the block was created. This allows any participant in the network to verify the state at a given point in time by comparing hashes, ensuring integrity.


## Role in Organizing and Securing Data on the Ethereum Blockchain:

Merkle Patricia Trees play a crucial role in both organizing and securing data on the Ethereum blockchain:

1. Organizing Data:

The trie allows for efficient access to data by ensuring that shared prefixes are merged. This minimizes the storage space required for storing state data.

As Ethereum grows and the number of accounts and smart contracts increases, the trie structure allows for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions of state data, which is important for maintaining performance.


2. Securing Data:

Hashing ensures data integrity. Since each node in the trie is hashed, any change in the data will result in a different hash, which can easily be detected. This makes it impossible to tamper with data without alerting everyone.

Merkle Proofs: When a node or piece of data is requested, a Merkle proof is used. A Merkle proof allows one to verify the authenticity of a piece of data without needing the entire dataset, using only the hashes along the path from the leaf to the root. This is key for light clients (clients that don’t store the entire blockchain) to verify data.


3. Ensuring Consensus and Security:  The Ethereum blockchain relies on consensus, and Merkle Patricia Tries help achieve this. By organizing data in a structured way and hashing it, the network can quickly verify the state, ensuring everyone agrees on the current state of the blockchain.


In Summary:

Merkle Patricia Tries in Ethereum combine the benefits of both Merkle Trees and Patricia Tries. They allow for the efficient organization of state data (such as accounts, smart contract storage, and transactions) and ensure that data remains secure and verifiable. The use of these trees in the EVM ensures both performance and security, enabling Ethereum to scale while maintaining integrity.
