## Merkle Patricia Trees in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

Merkle Patricia Trees play a crucial role in organizing and securing data within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The state of Ethereum (comprising all accounts, balances, and smart contracts) is encoded into a special version of a **Merkle Tree**, which creates a verifiable relationship between individual pieces of data, resulting in a single root value. This root value can be used to prove the validity of the data stored in the tree.

Ethereum uses a **Merkle Patricia Trie**, which is a combination of the Merkle Tree and the Patricia Trie (Practical Algorithm to Retrieve Information Coded in Alphanumeric). This modified structure allows for efficient retrieval of Ethereum's state data.

### What is a Merkle Patricia Trie?

A **Merkle Patricia Trie** is a cryptographically secure, deterministic data structure designed to store and retrieve data in a way that ensures integrity and provides efficient updates. The structure combines the benefits of both **Merkle Trees** (which are used to verify the integrity of data) and **Patricia Tries** (which optimize the retrieval process).

In this tree structure, every node contains a **cryptographic hash** (e.g., using `keccak256`), ensuring the integrity of all data beneath it. The root of the tree represents the entire state of Ethereum, while the individual nodes represent key-value pairs, where keys are the **addresses** and the values represent the state (like account balances and contract storage).

### Key Features and Components

1. **Deterministic and Verifiable:**

   - The root of the Merkle Patricia Trie can only be generated by computing it from each individual piece of the state. If two states are identical, their root hashes will also match, providing a proof that the states are the same.
   - Conversely, any change in the state will result in a different root hash, making it impossible to modify the state without detection.

2. **Efficient Operations:**

   - The Merkle Patricia Trie achieves **O(log(n)) efficiency** for **inserts, lookups, and deletions**, making it highly efficient for managing the vast state of Ethereum's network.

3. **Node Types:**
   - **Branch Nodes**: A 17-item node containing 16 child references and a terminal value.
   - **Leaf Nodes**: A 2-item node containing an encoded path and the corresponding value.
   - **Extension Nodes**: A 2-item node that represents a shortened path and points to a subsequent node.

### Role in the Ethereum EVM

Merkle Patricia Trees are integral to several key aspects of Ethereum's state management:

1. **Global State Trie:**

   - Ethereum maintains a **global state trie**, which is updated every time a new block is processed. Each account is represented by a **key** derived from the **Ethereum address**, and its corresponding **value** is the **RLP (Recursive Length Prefix)** encoding of the Ethereum account details (such as nonce, balance, storage root, and code hash).

2. **Storage Trie:**

   - Each account on Ethereum has its own **storage trie**. This trie holds the contract data for the account and is identified by the **storage root** stored in the account state. Retrieving values from this trie requires computing the storage position using the **Keccak-256** hash of the account address and the storage position.

3. **Transactions and Receipts Tries:**

   - Ethereum uses separate tries for managing **transactions** and **receipts** in each block:
     - **Transactions Trie**: Stores the transactions of a block, where the path is determined by the transaction index.
     - **Receipts Trie**: Stores the receipts for the transactions, including details such as status and gas used.

4. **Efficient Data Management:**
   - The Merkle Patricia Trie allows Ethereum to store large amounts of data efficiently by reducing the number of required operations for inserts and lookups. Each change in state only requires updates to the affected parts of the tree, minimizing the overhead of recalculating the entire structure.

### Cryptographic Integrity

- The **Merkle Patricia Trie** ensures that any changes to the state are cryptographically secured. By hashing the data and using these hashes to navigate the tree, Ethereum guarantees that data cannot be tampered with without altering the root hash.
- This structure allows Ethereum nodes to verify data integrity using **Merkle proofs**, which provide a way to prove that a certain piece of data is part of the trie without revealing the entire structure.
