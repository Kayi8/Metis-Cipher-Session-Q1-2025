## What is the EVM?
  
   **EVM(Ethereum Viartual Machine)** is a coputer whose storage is in the cloud it's connected to 
   several computers operated by users-web developers. The EVM is basically used to process smart
   contract transactions. The EVM only understands binary codes i.e 0's and 1's which is difficult
   for human, This led to web developers creating a high level language called solidity which is
   used to write smart contracts which are codes in english language. This codes is then compiled
   by an opcode which serves as a interpreter between the two -User langauge(solidity) and the 
   machine language(bytecodes), thus helping the EVM machine to process the set of instructions 
   written by the users(web developers)</p>
   
## Purposes and roles of EVM in the Ethereum blockchain.

   The primary purpose of the EVM in the ethereum blockchain are:
   - **Smart contract execution:** It executes smart contract which are self executing contracts 
   that follow rules or instructions written in codes
   - It also interpretes the high level language, solidity into bytecodes, compiles the 
   transactions and executes them.
   - **Gas Mechanism:** EVM calculates the gas costs of executing smart contracts, based on the 
   computational resources used by adding all the smart contacts on it na d multiplying it
   by the price of each smartcontract execution. Afterwards, it manages the gas fee by ensuring
   that contracts do not exceed their allocated gas.<br>
   This helps in preventing denial-of-service attacks by limiting the amount of computational 
   resources that can be consumed by a contract.
   - **Memory management:** EVM manages the data storage of smart contracts, including reading and 
   writing data to the contract's storage i.e its manages the smart contract storage effectively 
   ensuring that each smart contract do not exceed their allocated memory

## How Does the EVM Work?
   - Explain how the EVM executes smart contracts.
   Ethereum Virtual machine processes transactions on smart contracts sequentially, one after 
   another, if a process isnt working for one reaseon, the EVM skips the process to the next 
   transaction afterwards the EVM updates the sate of transaction that is to the current changes
   made<br>
   Each time the EVM update the state of transaction theres always a completr record of what the 
   EVM consist of before and after the transaction. This list of transation is what is called the 
   blockchain

## The role of EVM in maintaining security and decentralization.
  ### Security
  - **Memory management:** EVM manages smart contract memory allocations ensuring that contacts do
  consume too much memory space thus preventing memory overfloe attacks
  - **Gas Mechanism:** through thus tecjnology, EVM regulates the amount of computational 
  resources used by each smart contracts, preventing denial-of-service attacks and ensure that 
  smart contracts are executed efficiently
  - **Deterministic Execution:** The EVM ensures that the output of a contract is solely determined
   by the given input, ensuring that the input and output are same. This prevents unpredicted 
   error and  ensures that the contract operate as intended 
  - **Isolated Execution:** contracts are isolated from each other and from any underlying system 
  to prevent malicious contract from accessing sensitive data or distrupting the network

  ### Decentralization
  - **Decentralized Execution:** It enables decentralized execution of smart contract, allowing 
  anyone to make a transaction without a central authority or middle man
  - **Open source:** EVM allows developers to view and modify code of contract. hence its an open
   source. This promotes transparency, collaboration and community involvement
  - **Node distibution:** EVM is run by several nodes networked together, ensuring ethereum Network remains decentralized and resilient to single point failure. That is the failure of one node doesnt affect the efficiency of the smart contract execution
  - **Authonomous execution:** EVM enables automatic execution of smart contract when a condtion is met without relaying on intermediaries or any central autority

 **Why is the EVM Important?**
   - Highlight why the EVM is a foundational component of Ethereum and its ecosystem.
   - Mention its compatibility with other blockchains that support EVM.
