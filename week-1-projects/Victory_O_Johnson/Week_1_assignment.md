- Blockpoint.io, this allows retailers to build payment system around blockchain currencies such as Bitcoin, as well as blockchain derived gift cards and loyalty schemes

## **Part Two**
1. Identify and list the components of a blockchain by analyzing how Ethereum works.
2. Explore a public blockchain explorer (e.g., ethers.com) and explain how to track a transaction on the blockchain.

## **Answer:**
## How Ethereum Network works
Individuals (users) initiate transactions such as sending ether (ETH - a cryptocurrency used to pay for transactions and computational services in ethereum network) or execute a smart contract, a self executing contract with rules written in code. The nodes i.e computers that run ethereum software  and connect them to the network on the network receives the transactions.<br>
Afterwards,the miners - a group of individuals verifies it by using powerful computer to validates the transaction on the ethereum network by ensuring it solves a complex mathematical puzzle, execute smart contract and create a new block before the verified transactions is grouped into the block<br>
Thereafter, the validated block is then added to the blockchain which is linked to others with an hash- a unique string of characters that represents a piece of data which could be a file, message or a transaction on the blockchain. After which the nodes on the network then updates the copy of the blockchain.

The component of blockchain as regards to ethereum are:
- Network
- Transaction eg Ether
- Blocks on the blockachain
- Smartcontract

Others includes:
Consensus mechanism, Cryptography etc

## Exploring Ether.com and explaining how to track transactions ##

Etherscan.io an explorer used to track the transactions of ethereum on a blockchain has lots of 
futures such as
- Number of transactions on the block
- Latest block created and the latest transaction on the block
- The miners
- Transaction wallet ids for both the receiver and the sender
- Means of Transaction, Either Transfer or otherwise
- The gas fee involved, the time and status of the transaction
- The Transaction Hash etc

Clicking on the one of the blocks, one can see detailed info of all transaction on the block, 
including the block height, the status of the block- finalized or not,time created, Transactions withdrawals etc as seen below:

## Part Three
1. Why is decentralization important in blockchain?
2. How does blockchain ensure transparency and security?

## Answer
Decentralization is important in blockchain so as to ensure transparency, security and resilience to failure of the node, it's also helps in attracting developers to the blockchain knowing that their project built on the blockchain is secure as ownership of the blockchain is not to a person or group of persons rather everyone can access the blockchain and see transactions and it can't be altered due to its smart contract

## How blockchain ensures transparency and security
For transparency, blockchain uses Open source code  that allows developers to review and audit it, also transactions are immutable, due to smart contract, once in it cant be altered or deleted
consensus mechanism - protocol thats used to ensures that all nodes in the network agree on a state of a blockchain to retain the integrity of the of the Network, Hence preventing manipulation or altering of transactions, Types include:
- Proof of work
- Proof of Stake
- Proof of authority among others
  
For Security, Blockchain uses cryptography technology, which means securing data and converting into codes to prevent unauthorized access, decentralized networks of nodes makes it difficult for a single entity to manipulate the blockchain. Also for security purposes the blocks are connected to one another using a Hash function which is used to create a unique fingerprint for each block before connecting it to another. This makes it difficult to manipulate the blockchain

## Part Four
1. Research and explain the differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of purpose and functionality.
   
## Answer
## Purpose
Bitcoin as a digital currency aims at replacing traditional fiat currency such as the dollar and provides a peer to peer electronic cash system. While, ethereum is created as a decentralized platform  for building and deploying smart contract and DApps enabling  a wide range of use cases beyond digital currency

## Functionality
Bitcoin is used for peer to peer transaction,and focuses on digital currency and store of value while ethereum enables decentralized applications (DApps)and decentralized finance(DeFi), it also support various uses cases such as NFTs, gaming and social media

## Layer 2 solutions nad how they improve blockchain scalability
Layer 2 solutions are technologies that improve the scalability of blockchain by processing transaction off-chain that is outside the main blockchain thereby increasing the capacity of transaction and reducing congestion. it also groups multiple transaction together before sending it to the main blockchain reducing the number of transaction on the main blockchain. This is called batch processing
Example of this solutions include:
- oprimism
- Polygon
- Metis Network
- Arbitrum
  
## Metis Network
Metis network is a sca;lable layer 2 solution that enables fast, secure and low cost transactions on ethereum blockchain, making it suitable for large scale application.Its decentralized abd allows seemless imteraction between differnt ecosystem on the blockchain, promoting interoperability and colabolations with the blaockchain. These attribute helps increase the adoption of layer 2 soltions
## Arbitrum
This is also a layer 2 solution for ethereum network that is fast, secure and enables low cost transactions. it uses optimistic roll up technologhy to bundle multiple transactions into a sigle transaction to be processed on the ethereum mainet. Its key features like Metis are: Scalabilty, security, low cost transactions, and interoperability.
This below is a metamask wallet set with the metis network added:

## Procedures
* search https://metemask.io from your browser(chrome)
* download the extension and add to chrome
* create a new wallet or import one
* if creating a new one, secure your seed phrase, manually is advised orhewise puy in yor seed phrase to import your metamask wallet
* on the metamask home page, at the top left, click on the drop down arrow displaying etereum network
* Then scroll down and click on add wallet, there input the details of The network to be added, such as
- Network name: Metis Adromeda Mainnet
