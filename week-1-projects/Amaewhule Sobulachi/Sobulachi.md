## 10 Real World Examples of Blockchain Implementation
#### Healthcare
Blockchain is used to securely store patient records, track medicines and prevent counterfeit drugs. It allows patients to share their medical data with health care providers
#### Finance
Blockchain is used to secure transparent transactions and ensure security and decentralization in the finance sector
#### Supply Chain Management
Blockchain is improving supply chain management by tracking products throughout their lifecycle reducing the odds of fraud. It allows real-time visibility and data sharing.
#### Government
Blockchain is being used to efficiently store identity information, property transfers, and contract creation.
#### Cybersecurity
Blockchain is being used to enhance cybersecurity by distributing data between several nodes, making it highly difficult for hackers to take control. 
#### Media
Blockchain is being used to provide greater security for Intellectual Property (IP) and prevent copyright infringement.
#### Energy and Oil & Gas
Blockchain is being used to optimize energy trading, reduce costs, and increase transparency. Vakt, a blockchain platform, automates the trade settlement process
#### Education 
Blockchain is being used to securely store academic credentials and improve verification processes. 
#### Real Estate
Blockchain is being used to automate contract processing, secure property records, and enable fractional ownership
#### Agriculture
Blockchain is being used to track and record information about plants, seed quality, crop growth, and the entire supply chain, enhancing transparency and eliminating concerns related to illegal operations and unethical practices

## Components of a Blockchain(Ethereum)
1. Network:
Ethereum's network consists of a decentralized network of nodes (computers) that work together to validate and record transactions.
2. Transactions:
A transaction is a request to add, modify, or delete data on the blockchain.
Ethereum transactions include:
- Sending ETH between accounts
- Deploying smart contracts and interacting with existing smart contracts
3. Blocks:
Blocks are collections of transactions that have been verified by nodes.
Ethereum blocks contain:
- A list of validated transactions
- A unique block number
- A reference to the previous block (hash)
- A timestamp
4. Blockchain:
Ethereum's blockchain is the decentralized, distributed ledger that stores all transactions and blocks in a linear, chronological order.
5. Consensus Mechanism:
Ethereum uses a consensus mechanism called Proof of Work (PoW), where miners compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks.
6. Smart Contracts: 
Ethereum's smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written directly into code. They can be used for various applications, such as:
- Decentralized finance (DeFi)
- Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)
- Gaming
7. Nodes:
Ethereum nodes/computers can be categorized into:
- Full nodes: Store a full copy of the blockchain
- Light nodes: Store only a subset of the blockchain data
- Archive nodes: Store the entire blockchain history
8. Wallets:
Ethereum wallets are software programs that allow users to store, send, and receive Ether (ETH) and other Ethereum-based tokens. Examples include:
- MetaMask
- MyEtherWallet
9. Gas:
Ethereum's gas mechanism is used to measure the computational effort required to execute transactions and smart contracts. They are similar to bank charges in the normal banking system

## How to Track Transactions on a Public Block Explorer
In the etherscan( ethers.io), click on the Explorer tab and enter : 
1. ***Transaction Hash***: Enter the transaction hash (TX Hash) in the search bar to view the transaction details.
2. ***Transaction Details***: On the transaction page, you'll see details such as:
- Transaction hash
- Block number
- Timestamp
- From and To addresses
- Value (in ETH)
- Transaction status (e.g., "Success" or "Failed")

## Importance of Decentralization in Blockchain
Decentralization ensures that a single person or organisation is not in charge of keeping transaction records. It allows for differrent node to have access to the system hence ensuring security, transparency and integrity 
# How Blockchain Ensures Transparency and Integrity
#### Transparency
1. Immutable ledger: Decentralization ensures that the blockchain ledger is immutable, meaning that once a transaction is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted.
2. Publicly accessible: The decentralized nature of blockchain allows anyone to access and view the transaction history, promoting transparency and accountability.
#### Integrity
1. Consensus mechanisms: Decentralization enables the use of consensus mechanisms, such as proof-of-work or proof-of-stake, which ensure that all nodes on the network agree on the state of the blockchain.
2. Prevention of data tampering: Decentralization makes it difficult for a single entity to tamper with the data on the blockchain, ensuring the integrity of the network.

## Differences between Bitcoin And Ethereum
1.  ***Purpose:*** ***Bitcoin*** was created as a decentralised digital currency aiming to provide an alternative to alternative fiat currencies while ***Ethereum*** was created as a decentralised platform for building decentralised apps and deployinng smart contracts
2. ***Functionality***: ***Bitcoin's*** main function is to enable peer-to-peer transactions without the need for third parties while ***Ethereum's*** primary function is to enable creation, management and execution of Dapps and Smart contracts.

# Layer 2 solutions
They are designed to improve scalability of blockchain networks by reducing the load on the main chain thus increasing transaction spped and reducing transaction fees.
## Optimism as a Layer 2 Solution
It is a solution on Ethereum that uses optimistic rollups to process transactions off-chain. It does this by:
- ***Transaction Aggregation:*** Multiple transactions are aggregateg into a single transaction.
- ***Off-chain processing:*** These transactions are then processed off-chain via a sequencer
- ***Roll-up creation:*** The sequencer creates a rollup which is a compressed version of the transaction data
- ***On-chain submission:*** The rollup is submitted to the Ethereum main chain
- ***Validation:*** The rollup is verified by the Ethereum network ensuring its validity
- ***Validation:*** The rollup is verified by the Ethereum network ensuring its validity.

## Metis as a Layer 2 Solution
It uses a novel architecture to process transactions off-chain. It does this by:
- ***Transaction Aggregation:*** Multiple transactions are aggregateg into a single transaction.
- ***Off-chain processing:*** These transactions are then processed off-chain via a sequencer
- ***Roll-up creation:*** The sequencer creates a rollup which is a compressed version of the transaction data
- ***Zero-knowledge proof generation:*** A zero knowledge proof(zk-SNARK) is generated to prove the validity of the rollup
- ***On-chain submission:*** The rollup and zk-SNARK are submitted to the Ethereum main chain
- ***Validation:*** The rollup is verified by the Ethereum network ensuring its validity
