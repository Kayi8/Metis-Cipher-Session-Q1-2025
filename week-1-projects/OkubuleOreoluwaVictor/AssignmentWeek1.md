#10 REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES OF HOW BLOCKCHAIN IS USED/IMPLEMENTED

1) BANKING AND FINANCE : 
One of the industries that stands to benefit the most from blockchain technology is the banking and finance sector.
The operational time and duration of banks in day-time limits the 24/7 convenience of transactions.
They say if you try to deposit a cheque to your account 6pm on a Friday, you likely have to wait till Monday to view the transaction in your account. Even verification on working day takes a long time for approval.
By integrating blockchains into banks, consumers might see their transactions processed in minutes or lesser regardless of day or time because on the other hand... blockchain never sleeps.
This goes just as well for stock traders because of settlement and clearing process which takes time for validation... can be reduced drastically.

2) FOOD INDUSTRY: 
A food business industry like IBM and Walmart created its Food Trust blockchain to trace the journey that food products take to get to their locations.
Why do this? The food industry has seen countless outbreaks of hazardous materials that were accidentally introduced to foods which has taken weeks to find the source of these outbreaks or the cause of sickness from what people are eating off the products.
Using blockchain allows brands to track a food on each certain location it passes through in it's importation during exchange transactions..
Leading to faster tracking of the source of these hazards.

3)CURRENCY: 
Blockchain forms the backbone for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethers.
This design also allows for easier cross-border transactions because it bypasses currency restrictions, instabilities, or lack of infrastructure by using a distributed network that can reach anyone with an internet connection.

4) HEALTHCARE:
Healthcare providers such as hospitals and clinics can leverage blockchain to store their patients' medical records securely.
When a medical record is generated and signed, it can be written into the blockchain, which provides patients with proof and confidence that the record cannot be changed. These personal health records could be encoded and stored on the blockchain with a private key so that they are only accessible to specific individuals, thereby ensuring privacy.

5) INTELLECTUAL/PROPERTY RECORDS:
A situation whereby physical deed must be delivered to a government employee at the local recording office, where it is manually entered into the county's central database and In the case of a property dispute, claims to the property must be reconciled with the public index.
This process is not just costly and time-consuming, it is also prone to human error, where each inaccuracy makes tracking property ownership less efficient. Blockchain has the potential to eliminate the need for scanning documents and tracking down physical files in a local recording office. If property ownership is stored and verified on the blockchain, owners can trust that their deed is accurate and permanently recorded.

6) SMART CONTRACTS:
A smart contract is computer code that can be built into the blockchain to facilitate transactions.
It operates under a set of conditions to which users agree. When those conditions are met, the smart contract conducts the transaction for the
users.

7) Supply Chains
Just like the Case of IBM Food Trust example, suppliers can use blockchain to record the origins of materials that they have purchased. This would allow companies to verify the authenticity of not only their products but also common labels such as
"Organic," "Local," and "Fair Trade."
As reported by Forbes, the food industry is increasingly adopting the use of blockchain to track the path and safety of food throughout the farm-to-user journey.

8)Luxury Goods Authentication: Brands like LVMH use blockchain to combat counterfeit products by creating unique digital certificates for their items.


9) Insurance Claims: Some insurers use smart contracts on blockchain to automate claims processing and reduce fraud.


10) Digital Identity: Countries like Estonia use blockchain for their e-residency program, allowing people to establish secure digital identities for business purposes.




2) PART 2 - A

Based on Ethereum's blockchain architecture, here are the key components of how it functions respectively with the blockchain :

1. Nodes
- Computers running Ethereum client software Validate transactions and maintain blockchain state , Can be full nodes, light nodes, or archive nodes.

2. Blockchain Ledger
- Immutable, distributed digital record Contains transaction history Organized into blocks linked cryptographically and Maintained across multiple nodes.

3. Smart Contracts
-Self-executing code stored on blockchain Written in Solidity programming language which Automatically execute predefined actions when conditions are met and Enables complex transactions and decentralized applications (dApps).

4. Consensus Mechanism
- Proof of Stake (PoS) for validating transactions where Validators stake ETH to verify and add new blocks to ensure network security and transaction integrity.

5. Cryptographic Elements
- Public and private key pairs which form digital signatures from hash functions for block linking and security to ensure transaction authenticity and blockchain integrity

6. Native Cryptocurrency (Ether)
- Used for transaction fees (gas) , which are incentivizes network participants to facilitate value transfer and contract execution.

These components work together to create Ethereum's decentralized, secure, and programmable blockchain ecosystem.




#PART 2 - B


Based on observation this is how to track a blockchain transaction using a public blockchain explorer like Etherscan.

Key steps to track a blockchain transaction:

1. Transaction Hash
- Obtain the unique transaction hash (a 66-character hexadecimal string), This is the primary identifier for any specific blockchain transaction.

2. Using Etherscan (ethereum blockchain explorer)
- Go to etherscan.io
- Paste the transaction hash in the search bar
- Transaction details will display, including:
  * Transaction status (success/failed)
  * From/To addresses
  * Amount transferred
  * Gas fees
  * Block number
  * Timestamp of transaction

3. Transaction Verification
- Check confirmation count
- Verify sender and recipient addresses
- Review transaction fee and total value transferred



#PART 3 - A
1)WHY IS DECENTRALIZATION IMPORTANT?

Decentralization is important because it eliminates/reduces the vulnerability that comes with a single database storage location for a particular data or asset because decentralization scatters information across multiple hosts with every host or computer having exclusive access to track transactions with a method called peer to peer networking which reduces the vulnerability or unauthorized access of information because each modification has to be verified simultaeneuosly by each node.

#PART 3 - B

Blockchain Transparency.
Because of the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin blockchain, all transactions can be transparently viewed by downloading and inspecting them or by using blockchain explorers that allow anyone to see transactions occurring live. Each node has its own copy of the chain that gets updated as fresh blocks are confirmed and added. This means that if you wanted to, you could track a bitcoin wherever it goes.

#PART 4 - A

Bitcoin and Ethereum Comparison in terms of functionality.

Purpose:
- Bitcoin: Decentralized digital currency, primarily a store of value and medium of exchange
- Ethereum: Decentralized platform for building and executing smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps)

Technological Differences:
1. Consensus Mechanism
- Bitcoin: Proof-of-Work (mining)
- Ethereum: Transitioning from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake.

2. Blockchain Functionality
- Bitcoin: Simple transaction ledger
- Ethereum: Programmable blockchain with smart contract capabilities.

3. Token Characteristics
- Bitcoin (BTC): Purely monetary
- Ethereum (ETH): Dual-purpose (cryptocurrency and computational fuel for network operations)

5. Network Capabilities
- Bitcoin: Basic financial transactions
- Ethereum: Complex programmable transactions, dApp development, token creation, DeFi protocols

Primary Use Cases:
- Bitcoin: Digital gold, investment, international value transfer
- Ethereum: Decentralized finance, NFTs, blockchain applications, smart contract execution

Key Distinction: Bitcoin is a digital currency, while Ethereum is a decentralized computing platform with its own cryptocurrency.
