# Understanding the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the decentralized computation engine that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. 
It executes smart contracts and enables the creation of decentralized applications (dApps). 
The EVM is an integral part of the Ethereum network, ensuring that all transactions and computations are 
consistent across all nodes. This post delves into the functioning and significance of the EVM in Ethereumâ€™s 
ecosystem.
