# **Part Two**

### 1. **Components of a Blockchain: Analysis of Ethereum**
Ethereum, like other blockchains, has several key components that enable it to function. Below is a breakdown of these components:

#### **a. Distributed Ledger**
   - Ethereum maintains a decentralised ledger where all transactions and smart contracts are stored. Every participant (node) has a copy of the entire blockchain, ensuring transparency and redundancy.

#### **b. Blocks**
   - A block is a data structure that records a set of transactions. Ethereum's blocks also include additional information, such as the hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and metadata about the block.

#### **c. Transactions**
   - Transactions are the fundamental operations recorded on the blockchain. They can involve transferring Ether (ETH) or executing smart contracts.

#### **d. Nodes**
   - Nodes are computers that participate in the Ethereum network. They validate transactions, execute smart contracts, and maintain a copy of the blockchain. Types of nodes include:
     - **Full Nodes**: Store the entire blockchain and validate transactions.
     - **Light Nodes**: Store only part of the blockchain and rely on full nodes for data.

#### **e. Smart Contracts**
   - Ethereum allows developers to write and deploy smart contracts, which are self-executing programs that run on the blockchain. These contracts are written in Solidity and executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

#### **f. Consensus Mechanism**
   - Ethereum currently uses **Proof of Stake (PoS)** as its consensus mechanism (following the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade). Validators stake ETH to propose and validate new blocks, ensuring the integrity of the blockchain.

#### **g. Gas and Fees**
   - Transactions and smart contract executions require computational resources, measured in "gas." Users pay gas fees in ETH, incentivising validators and ensuring efficient use of resources.

#### **h. Cryptographic Hash Functions**
   - Ethereum relies on cryptographic hash functions to secure the blockchain. For example:
     - Each block references the hash of the previous block.
     - Transactions and data are hashed to ensure integrity.

#### **i. Wallets**
   - Wallets store private and public keys, enabling users to interact with the blockchain. They are essential for sending/receiving Ether and interacting with smart contracts.

#### **j. Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**
   - The EVM is the runtime environment for smart contracts. It ensures that all nodes execute smart contracts in a consistent and deterministic manner.

---

### 2. **How to Track a Transaction on a Blockchain (Using Etherscan)**
A public blockchain explorer like **Etherscan** allows anyone to view Ethereum transactions. Here’s how you can track a transaction:

#### **Step-by-Step Process**:

1. **Obtain the Transaction Hash (TxHash):**
   - A transaction hash is a unique identifier for a transaction. You can get this from your wallet, exchange, or the platform where you initiated the transaction.

2. **Open Etherscan:**
   - Visit [Etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/), the official Ethereum blockchain explorer.

3. **Enter the Transaction Hash:**
   - Paste the transaction hash into the search bar at the top of the Etherscan homepage and hit "Enter."

4. **View the Transaction Details:**
   - Once the transaction hash is located, the following details will be displayed:
     - **Status**: Indicates whether the transaction is pending, successful, or failed.
     - **Block Number**: The block in which the transaction was included.
     - **From and To Addresses**: The sender and recipient wallet addresses.
     - **Value**: The amount of Ether transferred.
     - **Gas Fees**: The amount of gas paid for the transaction.
     - **Timestamp**: The date and time the transaction was confirmed.

5. **Track Confirmations:**
   - Etherscan will also show how many confirmations the transaction has received. More confirmations indicate greater reliability and finality.

6. **Inspect Related Contracts or Tokens:**
   - If the transaction involves a token transfer or interaction with a smart contract, additional details such as token type (e.g., ERC-20) and contract address will be displayed.

---

### Example: Tracking a Transaction
   - **Transaction Hash**: `0x9c7d...`
   - Enter this hash on Etherscan to find details such as:
     - Sender: `0x123...`
     - Receiver: `0xabc...`
     - Value: `0.5 ETH`
     - Status: Successful
     - Gas Fee: `0.00021 ETH`
     - Confirmations: 12+

This transparency is a hallmark of blockchain technology, enabling trust and accountability in the network.

### **Why is Decentralisation Important in Blockchain?**

Decentralisation is a core principle of blockchain technology and offers the following benefits:

1. **Eliminates Single Points of Failure**:
   - In a decentralised network, data is distributed across multiple nodes. Unlike centralised systems, where failure at a single point (e.g., a server crash or hack) can disrupt the system, blockchain ensures continuous operation by replicating data across the network.

2. **Enhances Security**:
   - Decentralisation makes it extremely difficult for bad actors to manipulate the blockchain. To alter data, an attacker would need to compromise a majority of the network nodes simultaneously, which is computationally infeasible for large networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

3. **Promotes Trust**:
   - In decentralised systems, no single authority controls the network. This removes the need to trust intermediaries, as users trust the blockchain’s consensus mechanism instead.

4. **Increases Data Integrity**:
   - Because all participants (nodes) store and validate data, decentralisation ensures that records on the blockchain are consistent and tamper-proof.

5. **Censorship Resistance**:
   - Decentralisation prevents any entity or authority from controlling or censoring the blockchain. Transactions and data remain accessible and unaltered, ensuring openness and freedom.

6. **Facilitates Peer-to-Peer Transactions**:
   - Decentralisation removes intermediaries, allowing direct transactions between participants. This reduces transaction costs, speeds up processing, and promotes inclusivity.

### **How Does Blockchain Ensure Transparency and Security?**

Blockchain ensures both **transparency** and **security** through its design and mechanisms:

#### **1. Transparency**:
   - **Immutable Public Ledger**:
     - Blockchain maintains a public ledger where all transactions are recorded and viewable by anyone with access to the network. For example, platforms like **Etherscan** allow users to track transactions in real-time.
   - **Shared Record-Keeping**:
     - Every node in the network has a copy of the entire blockchain. This ensures that all participants can independently verify data, reducing the risk of misinformation or fraud.
   - **Accountability**:
     - Users can trace the origin of transactions and verify the parties involved. While blockchain preserves anonymity through cryptographic addresses, transaction history remains visible.

#### **2. Security**:
   - **Cryptographic Hashing**:
     - Transactions and data are secured using cryptographic hash functions (e.g., SHA-256). Once data is added to a block, it is converted into a unique hash, making it virtually impossible to alter without detection.
   - **Consensus Mechanisms**:
     - Blockchain relies on consensus protocols like **Proof of Work (PoW)** or **Proof of Stake (PoS)** to validate transactions. These mechanisms ensure that only valid transactions are added to the blockchain.
   - **Decentralisation**:
     - With data distributed across many nodes, no single entity controls the blockchain, making it resistant to tampering and cyberattacks.
   - **Immutable Data**:
     - Once data is added to the blockchain, it cannot be altered without consensus from the majority of nodes. This immutability protects against fraud and ensures data integrity.
   - **Private-Public Key Cryptography**:
     - Blockchain uses cryptographic keys to secure access. Users sign transactions with their private keys, ensuring authenticity, while public keys allow others to verify the signature without exposing sensitive information.
