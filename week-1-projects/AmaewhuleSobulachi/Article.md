# MERKLE PARTRICIA TRIE

The Merkle Patricia Trie is a brilliant combination of two powerful data structures to create a system optimized for the unique challenges of blockchain platforms.  It is a combination of a Merkle tree and a Patricia tree. 
MPT is a data structure used in the EVM to efficiently store and retrieve data.

# ROLE OF MPT IN THE EVM

MPTs play a crucial role in the EVM by:

- Organizing data in a way that allows for efficient storage and retrieval
- Securing data by providing a cryptographically secure way to verify data integrity

In the EVM, MPTs are used to store data such as:

- Smart contract code
- Smart contract data
- Transaction data

By using MPTs, the EVM can efficiently manage large amounts of data, ensuring the security and integrity of the Ethereum network.

#### Ensuring Data Integrity

MPTs ensure data integrity through the following mechanisms:

***_Hashing:_*** Each node in the MPT represents a hash of its child nodes. This creates a hierarchical structure where each node's hash depends on the hashes of its child nodes.

***_Merkle Roots:_*** The root node of the MPT represents the Merkle root, which is a hash of all the data stored in the tree. This allows for efficient verification of data integrity.

***_Proofs:_*** MPTs enable the creation of proofs that demonstrate the inclusion or exclusion of specific data in the tree. These proofs are essential for verifying data integrity.

#### Enabling Efficient Storage and Retrieval

MPTs enable efficient storage and retrieval of data through:

***_Patricia Tree Structure:_*** The Patricia tree structure allows for efficient storage of sparse data, reducing storage requirements.

***_Node Compression:_*** MPTs compress nodes to reduce storage requirements, making it more efficient to store and retrieve data.
Fast Lookup and Insertion: MPTs enable fast lookup and insertion of data, with an average time complexity of O(log n).
