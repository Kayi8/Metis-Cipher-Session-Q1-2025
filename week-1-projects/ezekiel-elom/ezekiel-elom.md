# **Week 1 Tasks**

## **Part One**

### **10 Real-World Blockchain Use Cases and How It Adds Value**  

1. **Finance (Cryptocurrencies)**: Enables fast, borderless transactions without needing banks. Example:       Bitcoin.  
   **Value**: Reduces fees and delays in international payments.  

2. **Healthcare (Patient Records)** : Blockchain securely stores and shares medical records.  
   **Value**: Improves privacy and accuracy while allowing access only to authorized parties.  

3. **Supply Chain**: Tracks products from production to delivery. Example: IBM Food Trust.  
   **Value**: Increases transparency and reduces fraud or counterfeiting.  

4. **Gaming**: Allows players to truly own in-game assets via NFTs.  
   **Value**: Adds value to digital collectibles and ensures ownership.  

5. **Insurance**: Automates claims processing through smart contracts.  
   **Value**: Speeds up payouts and reduces disputes.  

6. **Education (Certificates)**: Stores academic records and certificates securely.  
    **Value**: Prevents fraud and simplifies credential verification.  
    
7. **Government (Voting Systems)**: Ensures protected and transparent elections.  
   **Value**: Builds trust in the voting process with verifiable results.  

8. **Real Estate**: Manages property records and smart contracts for buying/selling.  
   **Value**: Speeds up transactions and reduces paperwork errors.  

9. **Energy (P2P Energy Trading)**: Facilitates direct energy sales between users. Example: Power Ledger.  
   **Value**: Makes renewable energy sharing more accessible and efficient.  

10. **Digital Identity**: Creates secure, self-managed digital identities.  
   **Value**: Prevents identity theft and simplifies verification processes.  





## **Part Two**

### **Components of a Blockchain (Using Ethereum as an Example)**  

1. **Blocks**: Data containers that store transactions.  
2. **Nodes**: Computers that maintain and validate the blockchain.  
3. **Consensus Mechanism**: Ethereum uses Proof of Stake (PoS) to agree on valid transactions.  
4. **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing agreements coded into the blockchain.  
5. **Cryptographic Hashing**: Secures data and links blocks.  
6. **Wallets**: Tools for storing and managing crypto assets.  
7. **Virtual Machine (EVM)**: Executes Ethereum smart contracts.  


### **How to Track a Blockchain Transaction**  

1. Visit a blockchain explorer like ([etherscan.io] - https://etherscan.io).  
2. Enter the transaction hash (unique ID) in the search bar.  
3. View details like sender, receiver, amount, fees, and confirmation status.  



## **Part Three**

### **Why Decentralization is Important in Blockchain**  
Decentralization means no single authority controls the network.  

**Why it is important**:  
- Prevents censorship.  
- Reduces the risk of system failures.  
- Encourages transparency and fairness.  

### **How Blockchain Ensures Transparency and Security**  

- **Transparency**: All transactions are public and traceable on the blockchain.  
- **Security**: Data is encrypted and immutable, meaning it can't be tampered with.  



## **Part Four**

### **Differences Between Bitcoin and Ethereum**  
- **Purpose**:  
  - Bitcoin is primarily digital money.  
  - Ethereum supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).  
- **Functionality**:  
  - Bitcoin is simpler, focusing on transactions.  
  - Ethereum is more versatile, enabling programmable logic.  


### **Layer 2 Solutions and Blockchain Scalability**  
Layer 2 solutions build on top of main blockchains to reduce congestion. They process transactions off-chain and later settle them on-chain.  

**Examples**:  
1. **Metis**: Uses rollups to bundle transactions and execute them more efficiently.  
2. **Polygon**: Adds sidechains to offload transactions from Ethereum, speeding up and lowering costs.
