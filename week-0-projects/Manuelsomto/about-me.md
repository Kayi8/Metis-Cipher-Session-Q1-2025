Introduction
Hi, I'm Emmanuel Irechukwu, a self-taught backend developer with a focus on Node.Js and Express frameworks. I'm passionate about learning new technologies and their application in the real world.

Expectations
I joined this program to enhance my skills in Web3 development, network and collaborate with other developers in the space.

Experience So Far
So far, the program has been exciting. Learning GitHub in Week 0 has been an interesting one. Though I have some knowledge of github, this will be the first time I will be contributing and also using it to collaborate.
